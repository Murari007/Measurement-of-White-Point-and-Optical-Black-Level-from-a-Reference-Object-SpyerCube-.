# Measurement of White Point and Optical Black Level from a Reference Object SpyderCube.

SpyderCube is a Color Calibration tool which is used for color correction and white balance adjustment in digital photography and video. 
It is a small cube-shaped device that consists of different surfaces with specific colors and tones. The SpyderCube is primarily used to 
achieve accurate and consistent color reproduction in your photographs. By including the SpyderCube in a reference shot during a photo session, 
you can use it as a reference point for adjusting colors during post-processing. The cube's surfaces include black, white, neutral gray, and a range of other colors, 
which can be used to determine proper exposure, contrast, and color balance.

# Purpose

### Accurate color reproduction:
Achieving accurate color reproduction is crucial for photographers and videographers who want their images or
videos to reflect the true colors of the scene they captured. <br>
### White balance adjustment: 
Proper white balance is crucial for accurate color reproduction. The SpyderCube allows you to measure the white 
and neutral gray surfaces, providing a reference point for setting the correct white balance in your images or videos. <br>
### Exposure and contrast adjustments: 
The black and white surfaces of the SpyderCube help you determine the proper exposure and adjust the contrast
in your images. By measuring the values and comparing them to the black and white surfaces, you can ensure that your 
images have the desired tonal range, with deep blacks and pure whites, without losing details.
